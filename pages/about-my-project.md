project_title: "FIFA Club World Cup 2025: Developing Post-game content using AI for automated soccer box scores and video news reports"

problem: |
    -The project addresses the increasing demand for quick, accurate sports highlights while offering students valuable hands-on experience in rapidly growing fields. By working with live match data, creating automated box scores, and generating one-minute video news segments, students will gain practical skills in machine learning, natural language processing, and audio synthesis. This experience will equip them with the expertise needed to excel in the evolving landscape where sports media and artificial intelligence intersect.

    -This project aims to create an automated system for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 and  FIFA World Cup 2026 that delivers near real-time post-game content. Leveraging machine learning, deep learning models, and advanced transformers libraries, the system will generate concise game summaries and transform them into engaging audio/video news segments with natural-sounding voice narration.

approach: |
    - We will create a working system that ingests live match data and produces concise textual overviews (e.g., box scores, game highlights).

    - We will also create a model that seamlessly converts the generated summaries into clear, natural-sounding audio clips.

    - We will develop a data handling framework (e.g., notebooks, scripts) illustrating how match statistics are collected, processed, and fed into the AI pipelines.

    - We will analyze pass soccer matches summary from sport news outlet to create authentic game summaries for the model

    - We will make a final presentation or report summarizing the technical details, challenges, and lessons learned, highlighting how the system meets real-world needs in sports media.

    - A literature review of past work done on soccer news with ai/ml models

outcome: |
    - The end result will be a cutting-edge platform providing timely, digestible soccer coverage to fans and media outlets.
    - One aspect of the end result will be a text summary of the soccer match generated fully from the AI model using the box score of the match.
    - The other aspect is that the AI model will be able to perform text to speech on the summary so the model will be able to read out the summary it made completely on it's own.
