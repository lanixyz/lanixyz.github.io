  bio: |
    I‚Äôm currently a Sophmore studying Math and Computer Science at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia. I expect to graduate in 2028.

    I plan to continue studying Computer Science and Artificial Intellegence to one day be able to create programs/programming for robots for companies like The NBA, Google, Meta, etc.

    When I‚Äôm not working on research, I enjoy playing and watching basketball, fashion and music, and watching Anime, Marvel, and Star Wars content in my free time.

      description: Fashion is a way I have been able to express myself and make myself stand out from others. My journey through fashion has been a way for me to really express my journey through life. Some of my favorite artists are Ken Carson, Lucki, Frank Ocean, Tana, Playboi Carti, and Destroy Lonely.
