what_i_learned: |
  Today we learned how to convert series to a data frame. We also learned some new fuctions. We learned how to get the maxinmum and minimum values in the data frame, how to use comparative operators in the data frame, and how to only pull certain columns within our data frame. While we were practicing we learned that to pull columns form our data we have to specifically reference our data frame because if we just ask it "who is the tallest in the data set" it only returns the numerical value. However, if we call our data frame as a list and include whatever column we are trying to pull from we will get the right results.

reflection: |
  This was a great week. I learned alot this week and I can't wait for the weeks ahead. Any blockers or challenges I had I was able to work through them pretty smoothly with asking questions and getting help. Today we had a little bit of a challenge in trying to pull columns from our data frame but my group worked together and we were able to overcome our challenges. This week was a great introductory week to learn some essential concepts to help us complete our project and I'm ready to really start attacking our project.
