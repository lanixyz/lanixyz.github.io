what_i_learned: |
  This morning I learned about Computer Vision with Andrew Kelly. He taught us about object detection, image classification, object tracking, and image segmentation. Computer Vision is the proccess of a computer using cameras to take pictures or videos of things around them. The computer breaks the images down into pixles and draws boxes around the things it recognizes. The computer learns from many examples to be able to accurately label objects. To practice this, Andrew had us use Google Teachable Machine to show us the proccess the computer goes through. After that we took pictures from the internet and coded computer vision using python. After this, I went into my project group and we had to complete an escape room before we could have lunch. After lunch I went into Python 101 and learned about variables and the input/output cycle. I learned how to properly code variables in python and how to code a way for users to put their own input into the program.

reflection: |
  To reflect on today it was another fun and eventful day. Learning computer vision was fun and even though it wasn't the first time I worked with the concept, I gained a better understanding of it after working with it today. At first the escape room was challenging but with communication it became easier and easier and my group made it out in I would say 25 minutes or so. In my Python 101 lesson today I didn't learn anything new however it was a good refresher and a way I can stay sharp on the fundementals of coding in Python.
