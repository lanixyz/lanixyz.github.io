what_i_learned: |
  Today we did some more recording with our voices. It's going to take some time since our model needs a lot of training. We also did some more fine-tuning to our code. We went back over it and made sure everything made sense and was running as smooth as it could. We also want our commentary to be as realistic as possible.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was pretty good. We had a great week overall. We made really good progress and will make even more next week. Today we also recorded our video which went smoothly. I'm ready for the weekend.
