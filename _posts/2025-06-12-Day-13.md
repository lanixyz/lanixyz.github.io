what_i_learned: |
  Today was the second Cohort Connect day. We played a game called Taboo which is like charades but with words. I was apart of team 1 and we started off strong by having a huge lead. I feel like I did a pretty good job of describing the words so my team could win. But, at the end we ended up losing by a couple points which sucks. After that we played Jenga with the huge blocks. This time my team won and we gained the privilege to either show up a hour late or leave a hour early. Afterwards, Micheal showed us how to use Overleaf. When I got with my project group, we worked on making summaries of games so we could use them to train our model.

  No Blockers.

  Today was super fun. I really liked playing the games with my peers, hopefully we do more things like that. I will definetly using that leave an hour early pass to my advantage. Today was a very light day overall.
