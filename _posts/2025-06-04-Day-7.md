what_i_learned: |
  Today Daniel taught us more about coding with API's. We learned about calling the API using it's link and also how to find and use the API key. Daniel taught us how to make a data frame with the raw data. To do this we had to create a for loop that creates a dictionary to organize all the data. Once we did that we displayed the data frame with various rows and columns. Also Daniel talked about training and testing our model with independent and dependent variables.


blockers: |
  I got a little lost when we we creating the data frame but i understand it more now.

reflection: |
  All in all today was a busy day with alot of new information. I am very tired from today. I feel pretty confident on manipulating API's and data sets but I still need some more practice. My group accomplished a lot today and we had a lot of great conversations. Daniel is a great mentor and I'm glad to be working with him.
