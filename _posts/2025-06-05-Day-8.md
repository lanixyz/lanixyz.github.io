what_i_learned: |
  Today was the first Cohort Connect day. For our first day we took a tour around Morgan State's campus. We started out in the business building and went around all of campus. We stopped at the communication building, engineering building, student center, gym, and many more. During the tour I had the opportunity to have conversations with people outside of my group and got to know them. During my group session, alot of questions I had yesterday got cleared up. I am not confused anymore with sorting through lists and dictionaries.

reflection: |
  Although it was pretty hot outside, I enjoyed today and taking a tour of Morgan because it gave me a chance to meet new people. I enjoyed the conversations I had today and it was refreshing to find new community outside of my project group. Going into my group session, my head was very cloudy from all the information we went over yesterday. After some explaining and clear examples, I am more clear on my questions and we have come to realize that out data set is going to be a real challenge to unpack.
