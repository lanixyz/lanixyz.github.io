what_i_learned: |
  Today we learned about natural language processing which included steminization and limitation. NLTK is the Python library used for performing natural language processing. SnowballStemmer and PorterStemmer were 2 different NLP functions we learned about today. Additionally, we came to the discovery that to get the correct information we needed for our soccer API we needed to use a different endpoint. Before we were pulling data from a broader category in out data set instead of what we were really trying to get because we were using the wrong endpoint.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a day packed with a whole lot of information. I definitely learned a whole lot of new functions and concepts. Before today I have never heard of natural language processing and how NLTK is the library used to break up sentences. I will be going home very tired today from just the sheer amount of information we went over today. It started off a little confusing but I understood by the end.
