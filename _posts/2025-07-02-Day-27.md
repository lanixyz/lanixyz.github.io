what_i_learned: |
  Today we practiced for our presentation for the symposium. We made sure all of our slides were done and we filmed the video demo. We also went through and checked our info, made sure our code was good, and made edits to our presentation. We did a live runthrough to practice how we would present and gave each other pointers on how to make the presentation better.


blockers: |
  Our code started getting import errors for some reason after it was just working fine.

reflection: |
  Today was light but I am also nervous speaking in front of everybody tommorow. I'm ready to get it over with though and show everybody our progress. I feel like our project is really cool and we worked really hard on it. I'm ready to show it to everyone.
