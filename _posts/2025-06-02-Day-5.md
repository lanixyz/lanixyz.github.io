what_i_learned: |
  Today was the first in-person day of the program and we started off by being introduced to Dr. Nyarko and Dr. Waters. Dr. Waters gave us a presentation on how AI thinks with independant and dependant variables. She split the room in 2 sides and I was on the side of independant variables. She used baking cookies with an AI program to explain this. She talked about the terms deterministic and non-deterministic. Something that is deterministic is a calculator. A calculator will give you the same result every single time. However AI logic is non-deterministic. An AI program even if you give it the same prompt, won't give you the same result everytime. Multiple people can input the same thing and AI will spit out a different result for everybody. When I met with my project group we were shown the beginning of what we will be working on and how we will be using different aspects of AI to piece together a report. We also had a discussion on how AI is not changing jobs but it is us as humans who are gaining the skills to properly manipulate AI who are taking jobs. And even though some jobs are becoming obselete. the door for new jobs are opening.

  Today was a great day! I learned alot from Dr. Waters presentation and it was very engaging. Trying to build a tower with spaghetti noodles, tape, and a marshmallow was very fun even though our tower wasn't very tall. My favorite part of the day was when we had a discussion in our project group about AI and if it is or isn't taking over jobs. I learned a whole lot from it and it also got the gears in my brain going.
