what_i_learned: |
  Today I figured out how to code the function to train the model. I used the summaries I came up with myself to train the model. When I ran my code, the summary consisted of some of the phrases I used in my summary. We are getting closer and closer to making the summaries more human like and being done with the backend work.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a very successful day again. Daniel is a very good mentor and has shown me a lot. My problem solving skills are getting better and I have less moments where I'm just stuck. I felt very accomplished today.
