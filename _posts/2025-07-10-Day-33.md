what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first session in the writting workshop. The specialists did this to help us with our research papers. They explained what to include, how to format it, answered any questions we had, and showed some examples of other research papers. They provided a lot of useful information in their slideshow and gave us access to go back and use it as a resource. When I met back up with my group we worked on recording my voice to train the model.


blockers: |
  The workshop got a little boring at times so I zoned out a few times.

reflection: |
  Today was pretty good. The writing workshop contained a lot of valuable information. They were very helpful and very detailed with the presentation. Hopefully after the next workshop, I will be able to have the skills necessary to help my group craft an excellent research paper.
