what_i_learned: |
  Today we had another overleaf tutorial workshop. Micheal showed us how to edit the title part with our names. We also got showed how to add our references and how to properly format our paper in there. After the workshop my group got together. First we brainstormed ideas for our elevator video that we have to make. Then after that we worked on our research paper.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a succesful day. Now there isn't anymore confusion about overleaf. Also my group got a lot of our paper done. The workshop was succesful and I'm excited to make our elevator video.
