what_i_learned: |
  We built off of the progress we made yesterday. we were able to pull the in game stats from different soccer teams in a chosen season. We're getting closer and closer to be able to start training our model. I also learned how to simplify my code and how to retrieve every single match from a teams season and put it into a data frame. This process at first seemed really advanced but I was able to understand the proccess with some outside examples.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  I am very tired after today. We went over a lot and it was a lot to proccess at times. I made it through though. Now I know how to upload all the match data from a specific team from all the games in their season. I am also no longo intimidated by data sets anymore.
