what_i_learned: |
  Today we were working on our code for the TTS. We were able to get the voice training to work....kinda. The voice sounds like me but it is still super robotic. We spent most of all day trying to fix it but right now it's not working. Today we also planned our elevator pitch video and we are going to film it tommorow.


blockers: |
  So many annoying errors.

reflection: |
  Today was very stressful. Hopefully we can figure out these issues. I'm excited for our video it's going to be really fun. I'm ready to go home and rest.
