what_i_learned: |
  Today we came up with a new idea to add on to our project. We came up with the idea that not only will we have post game analysis but, we will also include a section where the commentators will provide predictions about the next match. The commentators will be using match data from previous games and using that to make reasnable predictions for the outcome of the next match. We also gathered more information for our research paper and went over the metadata for training our TTS model.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a pretty good day. We will finish our original project goals first before implementing our new idea. Today was kinda of slow because it was just a lot of tedious work. I definetly need a nap when I get home.
