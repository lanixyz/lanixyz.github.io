what_i_learned: |
  Today was part 2 of the writing workshop. We learned about new presentation tactics. Tactics such as wearing clothing that will make you "invisible" so the focus can be on the presentation. Another one that could apply to us is having cool props such as a soccer ball. We were taught to use words like "as a group we" and to transition by saying our group members name. During my time with my group we worked on training our TTS model some more.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a pretty good day. The writing workshop was ok I learned some new things from it. Wrinting is not my most favorite subject so even though it was insightful, it was not very exciting. I did my best to stay engaged though.
