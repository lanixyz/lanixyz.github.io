what_i_learned: |
  Today was the first day of orientation for the program. I met my project groupmates; Fawas, Nabin, and sumi while also learning about different people through the speed networking bingo game we played. Today I took a placement test that consisted of simple python concepts in multiple choice and short answer format. I also learned about Git and Github. Although Github was not foriegn to me, I learned about different Git commands such as git log, clone, and status. I also learned about a Distributed Version Control system. We ended off the day playing Jeparody going over the concepts we learned about Git. I was on team 1 and unfortunatley we lost.

  All in all, day 1 was eventful and pretty fun. I am excited about meeting my groupmates learning about Git and being able to do more with Github was fun and exciting. I am excited to learn more.
