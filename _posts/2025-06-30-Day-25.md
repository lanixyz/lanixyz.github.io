what_i_learned: |
  Today we made a function to be able to record a voice and save the audio file. We imported Sound device and scipy to be able to do this. We ended up running into the issue of every time we pulled a summary from a match it would be different. To stop this from happening we have to save our summaries and append into a separate csv file. Once we do that we have to set a checker so the same summary doesn't get saved twice.


blockers: |
  Our code started getting import errors for some reason after it was just working fine.

reflection: |
  Today was a little rough. We tried watching a video to explain the text to speech code to us but it ended up being very confusing so we are going to try to learn it as we go. Recording our voices went smoothly however and that was a nice step in the right direction. Now we have a big task in front of us to save our summaries in a separate file so the same summary will be used every time.
