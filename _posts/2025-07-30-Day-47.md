what_i_learned: |
  Today is officially the last day of the program before the end of summer symposium. I can't believe it's already over. I was so blessed to be put in this position and to meet so many amazing people. I love my group and loved every second I worked with them. Our presentation is finished and are ready to present it.

  Today was very bittersweet. The last day of us meeting is crazy to think about. This has been an amazing 2 months and I have learned so so much. so very blessed to have this opportunity.
