what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a mini cohort connect to clear up some things regarding our checks and how to use the timesheet. When it was time to meet with our groups I was able to improve my code by implementing a way for the user to choose the league and team without needing to know the ID number. Today I also worked on making my own human like summaries to be able to train the model to talk in a more human like way.


blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
  I felt really good today. Making improvements was really encouraging and also my group was on the same page. I am really understanding how to do our project and I am getting better with python by the day. I had fun today too. We had to share our room with another group and they helped us with some python concepts so that was nice.
