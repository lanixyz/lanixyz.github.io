what_i_learned: |
  Today we finished our research paper! Now that our research paper is done we are almost ready to present on thursday. All that we have to do is practice for our presentation and prepare for any potential questions. It's crazy how the program is coming to an end.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today we were able to finish everything pretty quickly. Once we finished up our research paper we did an activity with our highschool teacher. It was a great day all around.
