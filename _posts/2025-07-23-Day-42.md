what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on our research paper some more. I worked on the Challenges, Findings, and Results. Today we also filmed our elevator pitch video. We incorporated a soccer ball as a prop and filmed in multiple different locations. Our script was really good I feel like and the video came out great.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a very fun day. Recording the video was a lot of fun especially with my groupmates. We were also able to make great progress on our paper.
