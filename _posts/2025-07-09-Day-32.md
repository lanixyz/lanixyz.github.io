what_i_learned: |
  Today was centered around getting both of the commentators voices to work, improve what the commentators are saying, and find a more effecient way to store our data. I was able to succesfully create the TTS audio that contains two different voices going back and forth about the match. Also I was able to clean up the text so that the voices wouldn't say the "*" in the summary. We trained the model some more to make the summary more interesting.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a great day. We made a huge step in our procces by figuring out how to use multiple voices. It was a very stressful process but it was so rewarding when it worked. Now using our own voices will be easier.
