what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how to build a prompt using OpenAI's API library. I generated match summaries for Real Madrid using gpt-4o in python. We needed to have an API key and then we coded functions to build the prompt. After that we created another function to generate the summary using our match data. By the end of the day I was able to generate a summary for every single one of the matches.


blockers: |
  My only blocker was really debugging because it was challenging.

reflection: |
  Today was honestly a challenging day because I learned alot of new things. Learning how to build prompts within python at times was challenging but I think I get it. I'm excited to work on it more as the week goes on and get better.
