what_i_learned: |
  Today we made some really good progress on the voice training. It was challenging and not all the way done but my voice on guest is cloned a little bit. I sound british and like an AI still. We need to give it more samples so my voice is more authentic. We also recorded our video today.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  I had a really great week. Our group made a lot of good progress with our code and with our research. Also the workshops this week were pretty good, I think they will help us with our research paper a good bit. Next week we will finish the TTS training  and make sure our website is done.
