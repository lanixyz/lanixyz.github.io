what_i_learned: |
  Week 3 is complete. Today my group just went over what we did this week and making sure everybody understood what they were doing. We made sure all our code was right and didn't have any errors. We also talked about what we are going to complete next week which is the Natural Language Proccessing so we can train our model to generate the text. 


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  This week I learned a whole lot while having alot of fun too. The highlight of the week was definetly thursday for our cohort connect. This week I feel like I got closer with my group while also strengthening my relationships with people outside of my group. I am gaining more confident each day with complex python tasks and now i'm ready for the weekend so I can rest.
