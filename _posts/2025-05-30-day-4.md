what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about Booleans, Conditionals, Generative AI, Large Language Models, Deep learning, and how to tell the difference between AI generated pictures and real human pictures. In python 101, Clyde taught us the boolean values of true and false. We learned that booleans are another type of variable type. To go along with this, he also taught us about comparing with relational and logical operators. relational operators are operators like "<", ">", "<=", ">=", "==", and "!=". logical operators are operators like "and","or", and "not". During the second part of the day Clyde taught us about Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Deep Learning. Generative AI creates or generates new content such as text, images, audio, and video. An example of this would be ChatGPT. A Large Language Model is a type of deep learning algorithm that uses neural networks to process and understand human language. They are trained on large amounts of data like books, websites, and conversations with the users. They predict and generate text one piece (token) at a time. GPT-4 is the LLM created by OpenAI that powers ChatGPT. We also learned about tokenazation and embeddings. To end the day we did an activity where we had to discern if a image was AI generated or taken by a real person. By doing this we were able to recognize certains flaws AI has.

reflection: |
  Today was another really fun day. In Python 101 I felt really confident in what was being taught and feel like I can program more effeciently. I really enjoyed learning about Generative AI and Large Language Models. That lesson was my favorite part of the day. I learned alot of new things such as neural networks. Messing with the diffent generative AI programs such as Suno.AI where we could AI generate music was really fun. One of the AI generated images really tripped me out because it looked so real. This week was a really fun an educational week and I can't wait to learn more.
