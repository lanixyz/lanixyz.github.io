what_i_learned: |
  Today we were able to make some more progress on organizing and pulling from our API for the model. One of our main holdups was that we were not pulling the information we wanted. Our API contains a lot of nested dictionaries so today we fould the correct endpoint and was able to tweak our code so that we were pulling from the dictionary we needed. We have been learning new things about pulling from API libraries as we go.
