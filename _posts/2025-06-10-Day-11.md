what_i_learned: |
  Today we were able to make some more progress on organizing and pulling from our API for the model. One of our main holdups was that we were not pulling the information we wanted. Our API contains a lot of nested dictionaries so today we fould the correct endpoint and was able to tweak our code so that we were pulling from the dictionary we needed. We have been learning new things about pulling from API libraries as we go.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  I feel really accomplished today. I would say I made a couple of coding breakthroughs today and I feel like I improved in my coding skills. I was able to figure out how to sort through multiple nested dictionaries within our API. Today my group made some big steps within our code and also within our research paper. Tommorow we will be able to build off of the steps we made today and start on the next phases of our project.
