what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked on recording the FIFA club world cup matches for Manchester City and PSG in my voice. My groupmate Fawas also recorded the other commentators scriptin his voice for those matches. We have 30 voice recordings so far but we still have more we have to do since we have to go through all the teams in the cup. When we finished recording for the day we worked on our research paper. We made our outline more detailed and gathered some more points of information.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Recording today was actually pretty tiring. Especially since I wasn't able to do alot of them in one take. Overall we had a great day as a group. We made a lot of progress with our project and with our research paper.
