what_i_learned: |
  Today we met our high school teacher that will be working with us. Her name is Mya and she teaches history at Baltimore City Highschool. We also had our Cohort Connect where we just went over some technical things about the program. We also did an activity where we had to rank the importance of survival items if we're stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean. When we met with our groups Daniel had us do a fun Icebreaker with our highschool teacher where we re introduced ourselves with more facts that we didn't know about each other.

  I had a great day today. I feel like my project group gets along well with our high school mentor. She has a bubbly personality and very friendly. It was fun getting to know her and I feel like she will help us alot.
