what_i_learned: |
  This morning Daniel taught my project group about machine learning. ML is essentially training a machine to predict something and It cannot be trained without data. It's different than programming because in programming you give it the input and the algorithim gives you an output. In ML, you pass both the input and output and the computer gives you a program. Machine learning recieves the data and output and the computer does the thinking and returns a program/modelfxs, while in programming the programmer does the thinking and the computer returns the output.

  Today was a great day! I learned alot from Dr. Waters presentation and it was very engaging. Trying to build a tower with spaghetti noodles, tape, and a marshmallow was very fun even though our tower wasn't very tall. My favorite part of the day was when we had a discussion in our project group about AI and if it is or isn't taking over jobs. I learned a whole lot from it and it also got the gears in my brain going.
