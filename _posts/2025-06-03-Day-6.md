what_i_learned: |
  This morning Daniel taught my project group about machine learning. ML is essentially training a machine to predict something and It cannot be trained without data. It's different than programming because in programming you give it the input and the algorithim gives you an output. In ML, you pass both the input and output and the computer gives you a program. Machine learning recieves the data and output and the computer does the thinking and returns a program/modelfxs, while in programming the programmer does the thinking and the computer returns the output. The second part of the day we learned about API's and how to use different Pandas built in functions such as read, head, iloc, and display.

reflection: |
  Today was a great day for learning new information. I learned alot of new details on machine learning and I was also educated more on the process of machine learning. So far there isn't anything that is too challenging to understand that a simple question won't answer. I feel like i'm learning a lot of new information and really internalizing it. Before this program I was introduced to Pandas but what I was working on didn't really required it to be used that much. After today I feel alot more comfortable with Pandas.
