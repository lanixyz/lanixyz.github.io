what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a workshop with Dr. Chris Crawford from the University of Alabama. He showed us the projects he's been working on that involve human interaction with machines. Essentially he's creating technology that can use brainwaves to move robotics. We were blessed to be able to try out the headband that is able to move a drone with our brainwaves. We also demo'd a device that reads our muscles and allows us to move a robot. After the workshop my group just worked on the litterature review of our research paper.

  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was really cool. The workshop was amazing and I learned a lot of new things from it. It was exciting to use a piece of technology that emmulates me using the force from Star Wars. I definetly want to be apart of the creation of tech like that in the future.
