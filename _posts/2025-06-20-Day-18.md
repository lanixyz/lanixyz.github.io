what_i_learned: |
  Today I participated in the driving simulation. It was a very cool expierience but also very weird. I was driving the car but it was weird not feeling the physics of driving. I couldn't tell if I was slowing down or speeding up which was trippy. The purpose was to see if I was comfortable driving with little robots on the bikelanes and crossing the crosswalk. The robots really didn't affect me. Also today we learned how to save our data in files through python so we don't have to keep calling from the API. We can use the data in our saved file. I also learned that if you put "f" before a string you don't have to worry about typecasting whatever value inside the variable you want to print in your string.


blockers: |
  My only blockers is that after I took the glasses off from the simulator, my eyes were strained a little and my vision had to adjust.

reflection: |
  I had a great day today. The Driving Simulator was really cool and I would definetly do another survey like that again. This week I would say was a successful week I definetely learned some new things. I feel really accomplished once again because I was able to overcome some minor struggles I faced last week.
