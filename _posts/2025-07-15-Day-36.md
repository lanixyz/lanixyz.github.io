what_i_learned: |
  Today the whole cohort met up and we did a seminar on our learning styles and personalities. My learning style I found out was Mild Kinesthetic which is very true because in order for me to learn I need to see examples of it being done and I need to practice doing it too. My personality was described as ESFP which is the artist, the actor, the tactful, and the interpreter. There were some elements I felt were true but there were also some elements I knew weren't my personallity. After that my group worked on our research paper and made sure we had all our recordings for the training and re-recorded the missing ones.

  No Blockers.

  Today was a great day all around. The seminar in the morning was very engaging and better than I expected it to be. I learned some new things while also learning everybody in my group has the exact same learning style which is crazy.
