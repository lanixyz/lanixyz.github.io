what_i_learned: |
  This morning I started off by meeting the Proffesor and Grad student that will be leading my project. The proffesors name was Edward Robinson and the students name was Owolabi Daniel. In our project we will be creating an AI model to give post-game reports of scoccer matches. 

  Afterwards, I went into the python 101 breakout room with Clyde and we learned about python, the term "REPL"(Read, Evaluate, Process, Loop) and some beginner principles. We learned about Strings, Integers, and Floats which are essential terms that need to be understood when coding in python. Clyde also taught us the functions "Print" and "Type". We went over some math functions that can be used when working with Integers. To help us better understand Clyde had us play kahoot and it was really fun. To practice these concepts we used Replit.

  When we reconvened as a group we added to the "about me" page on our websites. To end off the day, Micheal had us play headbandz as a fun group activity.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Overall today was a fun day. In Python 101 I knew basically all the concepts we went over but I did learn something new which was the "//" math operator. This operator performs floor division which prints out the quotient without the remainder. Today was the first time I played Headbandz and I'm really excited about starting my project.
