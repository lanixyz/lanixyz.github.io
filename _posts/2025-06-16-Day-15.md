what_i_learned: |
  Today is the first day of week 4! Today we created a Jupyter notebook so all of our code can be organized. We also realized that we didn't have all the data we needed so we went back and pulled the match stats from the players. Before we only had stats from the teams as a whole so we had to get the stats from the players themselves. By doing this we had to go into the documentation to find the new parameters we had to pass 


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a pretty good day. I feel we are going to make huge steps this week too. I had a little trouble at first trying to get the right parameters but, after i found them I was able to complete the task pretty smoothly. After we get everything we need we should be able to go into the NLP part.
