what_i_learned: |
  Today we touched up on our Mid-Summer Symposium presentation just making sure our information on our slides were right. We also were having problems with our model generating different summaries for one match. To fix this we decided to save our summaries to a separate csv file to create a kind of mini API for summaries. We did this so our summaries can be static and when the user gets a summary for a match it's the same summary every time. 


blockers: |
  I didn't have any blockers besides our model generating different summaries.

reflection: |
  Today was a pretty good day overall. It did get a little stressful trying to get our summaries to a csv files. Also it was fustrationg finding out that the summaries weren't the same. All in all today was a very productive day and we ended up fixing our problems.
