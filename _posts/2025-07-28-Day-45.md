what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on our slides for our final presentation. We are also basically done with our research paper. Once the research paper is done we can finish our slides for the presentation. Our biggest holdup is the litterature review but once that is done we are done.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was just a busy and chill day. We made a lot of progress on our paper. We also are almost ready to present.
