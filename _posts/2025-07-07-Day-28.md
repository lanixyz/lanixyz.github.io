what_i_learned: |
  Today we started off by doing research on what Text-to-speech model we want to use to create audio for our summaries. We decided to use Coqui TTS to implement in our phython code. We spent all day learning how to use it and how to properly connect it with our code. I was able to succesfully read out one of our summaries with one of the preset voices and save it into a .wav file. The goal is to train our voices so that the TTS is a real human voice.


blockers: |
  Ran into a lot of errors and had to do a lot of work in my terminal. Was confusing and tedious having to install new packages.

reflection: |
  Today was a pretty good day. I'm real tired from doing a lot of reading and trial and error. I did end the day off successful which is great and I'm glad we were able to make progress today. Now we just have to work on training with our voices.
