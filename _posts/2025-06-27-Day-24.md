what_i_learned: |
  This morning my group recorded our weekly video. This week was our first video with our highschool teacher. Also Daniel introduced Text-to-Speech and how we will be implementing it in our Python code. We also decided that we will need many different voices because we want to include different languages.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a great day to end the week. I got everything done this week and also learned the beginnings of a new topic. I'm ready for our presentation next week and to go into the next gear of our project.
