what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked on my part of the slides for the Mid-Summer Symposium presentation. One of my slides will be what I learned and I will be doing the demo video too. Also today Daniel gave us a lecture on Deep Learning. Deep Learning is similar to how the neural network in our brains work. We had a wellness meeting with our highschool teacher to plan out our coming weeks also.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a pretty chill day. Since our code is good for now we are just working on our presentation and having lectures. Our meetings went smoothly too.
