what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued to work on our research paper. I worked on the results section some more and also worked on literature review. We had to find some more articles for sources also. After the research paper we tested our second model on it's accuracy but we still have to keep working on it. The model is at 40% accuracy so there's still improvement that needs to be done.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was a light day honestly. We are almost done with our paper so that it can be ready to be published. The TTS model however is being annoying so hopefully we can figure it out so it's ready for the presentation.
