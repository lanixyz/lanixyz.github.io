what_i_learned: |
  Today we worked on our research paper and did some more learning on NLP. We did a lot of work finding credible sources to include in our paper while also making our paragraphs stronger. On the coding side, we practiced making some sample summaries that we can feed our model. This is so when it's ready we can train our model to be able to correctly summarize the stats and data. We also covered steminization and limitation some more.


blockers: |
  No Blockers.

reflection: |
  All in all, today was pretty light as in the things we did weren't to challenging. We were able to work on our research paper pretty efficiently. Also steminization and limitation weren't that challenging to understand and making practice summaries was pretty easy.
