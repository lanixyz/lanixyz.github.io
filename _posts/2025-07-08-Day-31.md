what_i_learned: |
  Today we were really focused on fine tuning our commentary between both commentators. We also ran into an issue that the summary was cutting off to early. We realized we had to edit the tokens used. Also we decided to make it to where the user can choose what team they want without having to know the team ID. We have to figure out how to make it to where we won't get different commentary for the same match but when you picked the other team.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Today was another good day. We made some more good progress and found some new problems to solve. We are steadily making our project more interesting and complex.
